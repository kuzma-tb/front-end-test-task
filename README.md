# Coralsoft Test Task

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tech Stack

- React
- Redux Toolkit
- RTK Query
- React Router
- Recharts
- Preline UI
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript
- Vite

## Features

- Sign In (without a backend)
- Home Page (Dashboard)

## Prerequisites

- You may install any validation-related packages.
- You must use Redux Toolkit, RTK Query, TypeScript, React Router, Recharts, Preline UI, Tailwind CSS, and Vite.
- You are free to modify or add files to the project (decoupling files where necessary is encouraged).

## Requirements

- Refactor the app code using best practices in React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and RTK Query.
- **Sign-In Page**
  - Implement email and password validation:
    - The email must be in a valid format.
    - In the fake backend, the email must be `test@test.test` and the password must be `password`. Otherwise, return a "User not found" error.
  - Display error messages for invalid inputs.
  - Implement a loading state.
- **Dashboard Page**
  - Integrate TheCatAPI's `/breeds` endpoint in `catsService`.
    - Follow this [link](https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=aZyiLrsCh#tag/Breeds/paths/~1breeds/get)
    - In the left sidebar, click on `OpenAPI Spec Doc` and then click on `Breeds`.
    - Use `/breeds` endpoint to get the data.
  - Implement charts for data visualization (fixing the existing ones if necessary).
  - Display a grid of cat information, including:
    - Name
    - Origin
    - Description
    - Adaptability
    - Affection Level
    - Life Span
  - Implement sorting and filtering using Preline UI (sorting and filtering parameters are up to you).
- **Hosting**
  - Host the app on Vercel or any other free hosting service.

## Additional Requirements (Optional but Recommended)

- Implement a dark theme.
